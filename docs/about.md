This program can be used to split M4A files by the chapter marks they contain.  
It will produce a folder named after the input file and one MP3 file per chapter.  
The file name and title tag will be the same as the chapters name.  

M4B audiobook files can only be used after renaming them to M4A. M4B audiobooks from iTunes will not work because of the embedded DRM.  

Make sure FFmpeg and the libmp3lame are installed on your system.
